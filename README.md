`train_phone_finder.py`   takes   a   single   command   line   argument   which   is   a   path   to   a
folder   with   labeled   images   and    labels.txt   that   has   been   attached   to   this description.   This   script   may   generate   any   artifacts   you   want   in   the   current   folder.
Here   is   what   a   terminal   command   will   look   like:
> p ython t rain_phone_finder.py ~ /find_phone
